            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:32685:40"/>diſcouragements, perſecutions, and ſuch like, but <hi>their ſtrength</hi> is from <hi>our baſneſſe.</hi> Why do you fear, (ſaith our Saviour) Oh ye of <hi>little</hi> faith? The fear is not from the <hi>greatneſſe of the danger,</hi> but from the <hi>ſmalneſſe of our faith.</hi> Were faith ſtrengthned, it would overcome the world, and be victorious. Think the ſame of the Prince of the world. Satan himſelf. 'Tis true; he is mighty, but mighty <hi>through us:</hi> were we ſtrong in Chriſt, we were ſtronger then that ſtrong one. It cannot be denyed, but that the skirmiſh is for the time ſharp, nay, ſometimes there is a long ſiege, and we beleaguered: then we muſt do as ſouldiers do; repair breaches, and ſecure all paſſages, and ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our guard, more then at other times. If within there be any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible matter, away with it, out with it; if any falſe, or ſuſpected party, out with him; and that done victuall, fortifie, barracado, make our ſelves as impregnable as we can: for that is moſt certain, which before was hinted, <hi>viz.</hi> It is <hi>our weakneſſe,</hi> not the <hi>enemies ſtrength</hi> and power, that ſpoyles us. We might proſecute
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:32685:41"/>the compariſion further, and call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you to make ſure the gates, and outworkes, to keep ſentinell: but the main of all is, Take in <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Captain of the Lords Hoſts;</hi> fight with his weapons, fight in his ſtrength, ſwear fidelity to him, and ingage him in the fight, and victory is ever on his ſide. To ſpeak all in few; ſee whence all our miſery came; namely, from our ſelves. Had we been true, hell it ſelf could not have ſcal'd us; and there the cure muſt begin: Purge ſelf, fear ſelf, guard ſelf, fortifie ſelf, gage ſelf. For the truth is; we are though not <hi>all,</hi> yet the <hi>worſt</hi> tempters and devils to our ſelves. Ingage we our ſelves to Chriſt, and Chriſt to us, and there lies our ſafety: unleſſe this be done, were we in Paradiſe with <hi>Adam,</hi> or in heaven with Satan, there were no more ſafety to us, then there was to them.</p>

He keeps off from God, and beats out himſelf, with his own inventions. So then view him either in the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance</hi> of his unhappineſſe, or in the <hi>progreſſe,</hi> or in the <hi>cloſe</hi> of it. <hi>All</hi> is hence, that he goes out from God, and ſtands out to the laſt.

               <p>WE have look'd upon man in a double eſtate: we have ſeen what he was in <hi>Gods</hi> hand, what in his <hi>own.</hi> Now we are to enquire what
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:32685:63"/>he is in <hi>Chriſts:</hi> Theſe words will give us a generall hint thereof. Where Three things muſt be done, (if we do well.) Firſt, the order; Secondly, the meaning; Thirdly the uſe of the words muſt be found out. For the firſt,<note place="margin">Order of the words.</note> they come in by way of Inference, that's confeſs'd. But whence they are inferr'd, is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> I remember, knits them to the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, eſpecially to thoſe words. <hi>[Not I, but ſin, &amp;c.]</hi> and his conceit is this. There the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had proved luſt, i. e. <hi>reſidex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and dregges of Originall ſin,</hi> to be no ſin, and here he concludes, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no matter of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Saints. But this cannot ſtand. For, <hi>firſt,</hi> the concluſion is too wide for the premiſes, if they were true; ſince other ſins may damne, though Originall ſin did not. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Premiſes and ground are not true. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay, That concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence and the reliques of originall corruption are no ſins; he ſaith the contrary, over and over in that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, in ſo much as <hi>Arminius</hi> cannot beleeve, that what he ſaith, can agree
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:32685:64"/>with a ſanctified eſtate. As for that verſe, <hi>[not I, &amp;c.]</hi> the Apoſtle doth not diſpute, whether there be ſin or no in him, that he yeeldeth, but from what principle that ſin comes; from a principle of fleſh, not of grace. Let's ſet by this then. <hi>Ames</hi> knits theſe words to the fifth Chapter. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the ſeventh. <hi>Others,</hi> beſt of all, as I conceive, to the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe foregoing. The Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving proved our Juſtification by grace, or faith, or Chriſt, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter come all to one, and taken off ſome objections, and abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapters, which might at firſt ſight ſeem thence to flow, he now like a good Artiſt ſums up and infers the main concluſion; as if he had ſaid. Now then ſince 'tis cleared that Chriſt is a ruits as well as <hi>Adam,</hi> and as full of life as he was of death, and puts forth this life effectually to free us from all manner of deaths, it hence followes, <hi>Therefore there is no condemnation to them that be in Chriſt.</hi> This the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and cobarence.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Meaning of the words.</note> Now for the words, what's meant, in the firſt place, by condemnation?
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:32685:64"/>Here we divide again. The Popiſh ſenſe is this, There is no matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnable, nothing worthy conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnation in Saints. This ſenſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive, for then it will follow that there is nothing worthy abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pardon in them: Then were they free from all ſin, for ſin, as ſin, is deadly, <hi>c. 6.</hi> at leaſt free from all mortall ſin, which the ſtate and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>David, Salomon, Peter,</hi> and thouſands more do ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute. This therefore muſt not be it, What then? The word imports a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnatory ſentence, as <hi>Mark</hi> 10.33. and elſewhere. There is none ſuch abides the Saints, the law is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and diſarmed of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning power, as to Saints, they are removed from under it; the law borrowes its condemning ſtrength from ſin, and that's taken off as to the guilt and power of it; as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle after ſpeaks. <hi>It is Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that juſtifies, who ſhall condemne?</hi> ſo then the beleeving Saints are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from death, they come not into condemnation. Some objections are made by the Jeſuits againſt this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. But 'tis not worth while
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:32685:65"/>to dwell long upon them.</p>

The Text doth not ſay, there is no condemnation, becauſe they walk after the ſpirit; he meddles not now in the concluſion with <hi>the cauſes</hi> of Juſtification, thoſe he handles elſewhere, ſome before, ſome after, but now he is upon <hi>the ſubjects,</hi> and perſons juſtified, and tells us in this place, not why they are juſtified, but who they be, and how qualiſied; or if you will, the cauſe or ground of their freedome is upon this account, becauſe they are one with Chriſt: the evidence and proof of this, becauſe they live under a new guide or Law, walking not after the fleſh, but the ſpirit.

               <p>Saints in Chriſt are in a very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py eſtate and condition. That's our Point, Our renewed eſtate is as <hi>good</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as it was <hi>bad</hi> in <hi>Adam.</hi> It is
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:32685:66"/>not for nothing, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes this his higheſt ambition to be all in Chriſt, and nothing out of him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9, 10. or this to be the higheſt honour and commendation to be ſtyled <hi>Saints in Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.1. <hi>Brethren in Chriſt.</hi> Col. 1. <hi>Churches in Chriſt,</hi> in his firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi> This the higheſt dignity the beſt ſeniority; <hi>They were,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, before me in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 16. 7. and 11.

Nay, and into the Glory of Chriſt, and his moſt glorious priviledges, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.14. Now that our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not more deſperate out of Chriſt, then bleſſed in him, will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear. If we conſider this eſtate, either ſingly or in way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. To begin with the latter.<note place="margin">1. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of others</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Adams</hi> eſtate in innocency was (as we have heard) a very rich <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and glorious eſtate, he was heire of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:32685:67"/>all the world, held all of God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, he was in the actuall poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all required Graces, and had in himſelf a power of perpetuating his eſtate in Fee ſimple upon himſelf and his for ever: a faire eſtate, but ſhort of ours now. <hi>Adam</hi> had not <hi>the heir himſelf</hi> as we have, had not ſo near an union with God as we by Chriſt; he had a good <hi>Land-lord,</hi> but not a <hi>Father</hi> by marriage; nor had he that ſecurity and warrantiſe, againſt all pretenders and claimers that we have: <hi>he</hi> held God by the hand, but <hi>God</hi> holds us. To ſay nothing of another life in heaven, which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam</hi> heard of, is more then we can tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the holy Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, are doubtleſſe in a very good condition, their eſtate is free, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſure, yet ours in Chriſt our head, exceeds theirs. They are <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;</hi> we are <hi>members,</hi> they are the <hi>friends</hi> of the bride-groome, we the <hi>bride,</hi> they have their perſonall glory and life, but we the ſame for ſubſtance with Chriſts; <hi>Job.</hi> 17. They are near to Chriſt in place and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, but not ſo near as we, who
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:32685:67"/>are fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Saints now in heaven. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> are in a bleſſed ſtate, and for time have gotten the ſtart of us; yet for the ſubſtance of the matter, we have as good, as ſure an eſtate as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; the difference lies in this, they are ſeiſed of it in <hi>perſon</hi> and in <hi>part,</hi> we in our <hi>proxy</hi> and <hi>head</hi> Chriſt; there we alſo ſit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Eph. 2.6.</note> neither ſhall they be perfected till we come to them. Now then to cloſe this comparative conſideration, If our eſtate in many things exceeds <hi>Adams,</hi> in ſome things the Angels, if for the main we hold pace with the ſoules now in bliſſe, having the ſame both heire and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, our eſtate is certainly good; <hi>Adams</hi> was good, the Angels better, he Saints beſt, and the Saints is ours or the ſubſtance of it.</p>

               <p>For ſuch as are already come home
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:32685:75"/>to Chriſt; Keep you well whil'ſt you are well, we ſmart yet for our firſt fall, though through grace there is ſome remedy provided againſt that; but take heed of a ſecond, if wee fall from the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> there's no more ſacrifice, nor ſacriſicer, no new word of Salvation, no new Chriſt; God hath ſaid, and done all that he meanes to do in order to Salvation by his Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. Hereupon it is, that our Saviour in the Goſpel, and his Apoſtles in their Doctrines and Epiſtles, drive mainly at perſeverance in the faith once given, and call thick upon us, for perſiſting therein, for ſtanding faſt, for ſtanding out, for overcoming and continuing to the end, in this bleſſed eſtate of grace; wherein now we ſtand; and labour nothing more then to take us off, from all other Chriſts, Goſpels, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, wayes, eſtates; it is the main drift of all or moſt of the Epiſtles. For well did they ſee that a continuance was as neceſſary as an entrance; they well knew our unſteadineſſe and fickleneſſe, and how licoriſh our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is after novelties; nor were they ignorant of Satans wiles, of perilous
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:32685:76"/>times to come, and therefore have they given us ſo frequent, and ſo loud warnings. Now beloved ſeeing you know theſe things before-hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that you be not drawn away from your own ſtedfaſtneſs, 2 <hi>Pet. ult.</hi> Rather grow in grace, and in the knowledge of Chriſt, and herein be ſo much the more ſerious, by how much the more buſie the tempter and his agents be. Let me tell you all the Doctrines of later Editions drive moſtly at this, to wreſt you from this eſtate in Chriſt, and to create and eſtabliſh another title and tenure. Hence thoſe new wayes of happineſſe without Chriſt. Hence the revivall of our crackt title in <hi>Adam,</hi> hence the deniall of Chriſts purchaſe, hence the addition of joynt purchaſers with him, hence the adding of more ſtrings to our bow, and the ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our righteouſneſſe to Chriſts <hi>ad corroborandum,</hi> yea and the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting of all the evidences and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances with our ſelves. Look to your ſtanding, and be true to your colours, Chriſt hath bought you to himſelf, and hath liſted you into his ſervice, betray not his right, who will never,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:32685:76"/>never, never, as he ſaith <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert you, if you flinch not from him: you know in whom you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, continue in the faith of Jeſus, as you have been taught the truth in him. Abide in the communion of Chriſt, in the grace of Chriſt, in the power of Chriſt, find all your hopes, joyes, life, ſafety, and ſubſiſtence in him alone, fetch all your ſtrength and life from him, nothing from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hold all of him, flye to no other title, aſcribe all to him, and, in a word, owe to him, and to him onely, all wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, redemption, ſalvation: whole Chriſt, or no Chriſt.</p>
